      <p>This page documents the networking Protocol of Ace of Spades 0.75, as well as
the extensions made by the community.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><a href="http://buildandshoot.com/">Ace of Spades</a> uses the <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/Features.html">ENet networking
library</a> for all server-client
communication. The initial source for the protocol information was the original
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyspades/">pyspades</a> source code, for which the
source for 1.0 was not released. Nonetheless, the 1.0 alpha client has been
reverse engineered to document the protocol.</p>

<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="protocol075.html">0.75 (and 0.76) documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="protocol100a1.html">1.0 alpha documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>The 0.75 protocol supports extensions, which allow adding new packets as well as
querying the support for client and server functionality.</p>

<h3 id="extensions-providing-packets">Extensions providing packets</h3>

<p>Packetful extensions are extensions that can be used to send packets. Each
extension has 256 packet types reserved for itself. This is useful for adding
functionality that requires sending additional information from or to the client.</p>

</table>

<h3 id="packetless-extensions">Packetless Extensions</h3>

<p>Packetless extensions are extensions that can not send any packets. This is useful
for signalling support for additional values in or certain behaviours related to
existing packets.</p>

<p>Packetless extensions exist as an artefact of the implementation of extensions.
As the space reserved for extension packets is limited, values above 192 do not
have any packet types left.</p>
