<h2>Revision History</h2>
<ul>
<li>2011-05-14  First release (Sean Barrett)
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document describes the format of the Ace of Spades
version 1 map file.

<h3>Issues</h3>

The map file appears to be a binary dump of the memory format
of the voxel storage of the voxlap engine.
<p>
It is unclear what happens if you don't obey the "surface"
voxel rule, i.e. supply colors for voxels which are hidden.
They may work correctly, or they might break the voxlap engine
since it loads the data unaltered. I haven't checked.
<p>
Similarly, I don't know what would happen if you stored
data out of order or tried to encode 0-length top color runs.

<h3>Map structure and motivation</h3>

<p>
The AoS map consists of a 2D array of "columns" of voxels.
The 2D array is <tt>width</tt> * <tt>height</tt> in size; in the current file
format <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt> are both 512.
<p>
Each voxel column is stored independently of every other column.
<p>
AoS distinguishes between three kinds of voxels: open voxels
(which represent air), solid voxels (which represent solid
space, but which aren't visible), and colored voxels (which
represent solid blocks which are visible, and so must be
drawn as some particular color). Colored voxels are also
called "surface voxels", because to be visible they must
be exposed to air on at least one side, that is, they
represent the "surface" of the object.

<h2>File format</h2>

<h3>Spawning</h3>
In this version of the file format, spawn locations are implicit.
<ul>
<li>Blue spawns in the region from (0,128) to (256,384)
<li>Green spawns in the region from (384,128) to (512,384)
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Gross file structure</h3>
The file is described here as a binary file of bytes (so there
are no endianness issues).
<p>
The file contains no header. The only way to detect that a file
is an AoS map of type version 1 is to check the first 4 bytes
and see if they are a legitimate span descriptor (see below).
<p>
The file stores the column data for each of the 2D map squares.
These are stored left-to-right, top-to-bottom; the first column
stored is (0,0), the 511th column stored is (511,0), and the
512th column stored is (0,1).
<p>

<h3>Column data</h3>
Each column consists of a variable number of "spans", where each
span contains several runs of voxel data. The spans are encoded
using explicit positions rather than lengths; we will refer to
these positions as "heights". Heights are measured starting from
z=0, which is the <i>highest</i> position in the sky, to z=63,
which is the lowest position (and must always be solid--it behaves
as water). Blocks at z=62 which are solid are indestructible;
they represent the lowest level of non-water ground.
<p>
A span consists of the following runs of voxels in order:
<ul>
<li>0 or more open voxels
<li>1 or more colored voxels (this document refers to these as the "top" colored run)
<li>0 or more solid voxels
<li>0 or more colored voxels (this document refers to these as the "bottom" colored run)
</ul>
A single column consists of repetitions of this span format. The last
span in each column is special, and ends with solid voxels extending
down to z=63.
<p>
(Note the straightforward rationale for this encoding: between any open voxel
and invisible solid voxel, there must be a colored voxel. In a normal
map, the ground is solid and the sky is air, so when encoding from the
sky down, it makes sense to start with a run of air and end with a run
of solid.)  
<p>
Spans are stored sorted from top to bottom (from z=0 to z=63).
<p>
Each span is stored as the following sequence of bytes:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
  <th>byte offset</th>
  <th>name</th>
  <th>meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>0</td>
  <td align=center>N</td>
  <td>length of span data (N*4 bytes including span header)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>1</td>
  <td align=center>S</td>
  <td>starting height of top colored run</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>2</td>
  <td align=center>E</td>
  <td>ending height of top colored run (length is E-S+1)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>3</td>
  <td align=center>A</td>
  <td>starting height of air run (first span ignores value and assumes A=0)
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>4 + i*4</td>
  <td align=center>b</td>
  <td>blue color for colored voxel #i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>5 + i*4</td>
  <td align=center>g</td>
  <td>green color for colored voxel #i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>6 + i*4</td>
  <td align=center>r</td>
  <td>red color for colored voxel #i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align=right>7 + i*4</td>
  <td align=center>a</td>
  <td>alpha channel for colored voxel #i, actually used for shading in unknown way</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
Colors of both the top run and bottom run are stored in the array. <tt>i</tt>
goes from 0 to N-1, first encoding the top colors, and then encoding the bottom
colors. The voxel heights for the bottom colors are implied by the starting height
of the air run of the <i>next</i> span; they appear just above the air.
<p>
The next byte after the above list (at 8+N*4) is the first byte of the next span of
the column. Thus the location of the air run of the next span is at (8+N*4+3).
<p>
As a special case, an N value of 0 means this is the last span of the column.
The last span contains air, a top-colored span, and all voxels below down to 63
are solid. The actual storage used by the span is determined by the number of top
colors; in other words, it is 4*(1 + (E-S+1)). Thus, that is the offset to the first
span of the next column.
<p>
We now summarize the interpretation of the lengths and positions of the runs.
<p>
<blockquote>
Let K = E - S + 1<br>
Let Z = (N-1) - K, or 0 if N=0<br>
Let M = A stored in *next* span, or 64 if the last span of the column
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Run</th> <th>Start</th> <th>End</th> <th>Length</th></tr>
<tr><td>air</td> <td>A</td> <td>S-1</td> <td>S-A</td></tr>
<tr><td>top</td> <td>S</td> <td>E</td> <td>E-S+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>solid</td> <td>E+1</td> <td>M-Z-1</td> <td>M-Z - (E+1)</td></tr>
<tr><td>bottom</td> <td>M-Z</td> <td>M-1</td> <td>Z</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<h2>Sample C/C++ code</h2>

The following code examples use two arrays; map[x][y][z] stores whether
a voxel is open or solid (counting colored voxels as solid),
and the array color[x][y][z] stores the color of the voxel
if it is a surface voxel.
<p>
Note the map is stored as 'map[x][y][z]', which is reversed from
the traditional C way of storing things.

<h3>Reading a map</h3>

<pre>
/*

 */

void setgeom(int x, int y, int z, int t)
{
   assert(z >= 0 && z &lt; 64);
   map[x][y][z] = t;
}

// need to convert for endianness here if we read 32-bits at a time
void setcolor(int x, int y, int z, uint32 c)
{
   assert(z >= 0 && z &lt; 64);
   color[x][y][z] = c;
}

void load_map(uint8 *v, int len)
{
   uint8 *base = v;
   int x,y,z;
   for (y=0; y &lt; 512; ++y) {
      for (x=0; x &lt; 512; ++x) {
         for (z=0; z &lt; 64; ++z) {
            setgeom(x,y,z,1);
         }
         z = 0;
         for(;;) {
            uint32 *color;
            int i;
            int number_4byte_chunks = v[0];
            int top_color_start = v[1];
            int top_color_end   = v[2]; // inclusive
            int bottom_color_start;
            int bottom_color_end; // exclusive
            int len_top;
            int len_bottom;

            for(i=z; i &lt; top_color_start; i++)
               setgeom(x,y,i,0);

            color = (uint32 *) (v+4);
            for(z=top_color_start; z &lt;= top_color_end; z++)
               setcolor(x,y,z,*color++);

            len_bottom = top_color_end - top_color_start + 1;

            // check for end of data marker
            if (number_4byte_chunks == 0) {
               // infer ACTUAL number of 4-byte chunks from the length of the color data
               v += 4 * (len_bottom + 1);
               break;
            }

            // infer the number of bottom colors in next span from chunk length
            len_top = (number_4byte_chunks-1) - len_bottom;

            // now skip the v pointer past the data to the beginning of the next span
            v += v[0]*4;

            bottom_color_end   = v[3]; // aka air start
            bottom_color_start = bottom_color_end - len_top;

            for(z=bottom_color_start; z &lt; bottom_color_end; ++z) {
               setcolor(x,y,z,*color++);
            }
         }
      }
   }
   assert(v-base == len);

<h3>Writing a map</h3>

The following code outputs a map according to the surface voxel rule;
it does not write out colors for voxels which are not surface voxels.
<p>
Note the map is stored as 'map[x][y][z]', which is reversed from
the traditional C way of storing things.

<pre>
int is_surface(int x, int y, int z)
{
   if (map[x][y][z]==0) return 0;
   if (x   >   0 && map[x-1][y][z]==0) return 1;
   if (x+1 &lt; 512 && map[x+1][y][z]==0) return 1;
   if (y   >   0 && map[x][y-1][z]==0) return 1;
   if (y+1 &lt; 512 && map[x][y+1][z]==0) return 1;
   if (z   >   0 && map[x][y][z-1]==0) return 1;
   if (z+1 &lt;  64 && map[x][y][z+1]==0) return 1;
   return 0;
}

void write_color(FILE *f, uint32 color)
{
   // assume color is ARGB native, but endianness is unknown

   // file format endianness is ARGB little endian, i.e. B,G,R,A
   fputc((uint8) (color >>  0), f);
   fputc((uint8) (color >>  8), f);
   fputc((uint8) (color >> 16), f);
   fputc((uint8) (color >> 24), f);
}
